# How to Get Your EmailJS Public Key

## Steps to Find Your Public Key

1. **Go to EmailJS Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account
   - Or: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/ → Click **Account** → **General**

2. **Find Your Public Key**
   - Look for **Public Key** or **User ID** field
   - It's a long string of random characters
   - Example format: `AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz123456789`

3. **Copy the Public Key**
   - Click the copy button next to it, or
   - Select and copy the entire key

4. **Update Your Code**
   - Share the Public Key with me, and I'll update it in your Contact.jsx file

## Current Configuration (Needs Update)
- Service ID: `service_czr4q3g` ✅
- Template ID: `template_az3pbib` ✅
- Public Key: `b3WNH8lsWgqrCbYWOqZ9P` ❌ (This is incorrect - needs to be updated)

## Note
The Public Key is also called "User ID" in some places. They're the same thing.
